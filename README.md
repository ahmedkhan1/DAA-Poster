#### Project topic:
## Joining and Splitting 2-3-4 trees
A 2–3–4 tree (also called a 2–4 tree) is a self-balancing data structure that is commonly used to implement dictionaries.The numbers mean a tree where every node with children (internal node) has either two, three, or four child nodes.

In this project, we have discussed the implementation of this 2-3-4 tree by joining and splitting.This repository contains the code of which shows the working of the 2-3-4 tree and a poster which will be used for presentation on the topic.The code is available and you can run the code by the following way:

1. Download the file **tree234.java**.
2. Open it on any IDE eg.eclipse,intellija ide etc.
3. Compile and run it.
4. Console window will open and the program will ask you to choose either to *insert/show/find* the keys in the tree.
5. If show is choosen,an empty tree will be displayed similarly insert will let you insert a key in the tree and find will tell whether the key exists in the tree or not.
